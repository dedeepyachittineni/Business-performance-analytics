# Business Problem Statement

The leadership team of an e-commerce company lacks a single, reliable view to understand overall business performance. 
Key decisions related to revenue growth, customer retention, operational efficiency, and seller performance are being made using fragmented reports.

As a result, leadership struggles to:
- Identify what is driving revenue growth or decline
- Understand which customer segments contribute the most value
- Detect operational delays that impact customer satisfaction
- Evaluate underperforming products and sellers
- Make data-driven decisions for future planning

This project aims to build an end-to-end Business Performance and Decision Intelligence system that consolidates key metrics, 
highlights risks and opportunities, and provides actionable insights to support executive-level decision-making.
